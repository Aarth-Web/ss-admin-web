# Read Aloud Feature - Continuous Reading Practice

## Overview

The Read Aloud feature is designed for students aged 8-15 to practice English reading with automatic pronunciation correction, similar to typing master but for speech.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Continuous Reading Flow**

- Students click "Start Reading" once and read the entire paragraph
- No need for repeated start/stop buttons for each word
- Automatic speech recognition runs continuously during the session

### üîÑ **Auto-Interruption & Correction**

- System automatically detects mispronunciations
- **Stops the user immediately** when a word is pronounced incorrectly
- Plays the correct pronunciation: _"Stop! The word 'example' is pronounced differently. Listen carefully:"_
- **Automatically resumes** reading from the corrected word

### üìö **Age-Appropriate Content**

Pre-loaded stories for different skill levels:

- **Easy Level**: "The Magic Garden üå∏", "My Best Friend üë´"
- **Medium Level**: "The Clever Fox ü¶ä", "Space Adventure üöÄ"

### üé® **Simple, Child-Friendly UI**
